## Splitwise Application

* This is project is the solution of [this assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17umZ1XZIHxKpNTg0QEQ-9vr3uD5f2LPrMHzoYUmc0Yw/edit#heading=h.sbex9fvfr3zx)
* To run the project, preferably import it using git ssh link in Intellij IDEA
* MySQL is the only external dependency which can be setup easily using _docker-compose.yml_
* If MySQL is already installed, just update the username and password in _application.properties_
* Tables and schema will be automatically created once application is started
* Easily import all APIs through [Postman API Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8102811/VUqpsHR9)
